    <ul>
      <li>My friends and I found a cat all alone in a park.</li>
      <li>The cat was friendly, but it had no identification.</li>
      <li>We drove the cat to a vet clinic to find its owner.</li>
      <li>When we opened the car door, it clawed me so it could escape and ran away.</li>
      <li>We chased it around the clinic's parking lot for a while, with no success.</li>
      <li>We had to call the clinic staff for help catching it, and they were able to grab it.</li>
    </ul>
